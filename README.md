# Mass-file-extension-change
Batch file used to change specified file extension of all files in a folder to other specified extension.

Example file type to enter: "png" no need for ".png"

I've found this useful in recent years since images tend not to be downloaded with the correct file extension but no need for conversion so I just have this rename all specified file extensions.

Be careful when using, I am not liable for people not understanding the tool they are using messing up!
